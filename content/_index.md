Hi, thanks for stopping by. I am Vineet, computer scientist by training and software developer by profession. At core I am technologist with strong inclination toward making products that change peopleâ€™s lives. I officially work in field of cryptocurrencies e.g. Bitcoin. I work with Citi Innovation Labs, here in Dublin. At Citi, I am part of the Blockchain engineering team. I am also part of a team that provides actionable strategic directions in financial technology space to Citi Execs.  When I am not fixing  smart contract bugs, I train neural networks on  real financial data. 


###  Machine Learning / Deep Learning / Data Products

I am working on populating this blog with everything i am learning about *deep learning*. I got introduced to deep learning through [fast.ai](https://www.fast.ai) international fellowship.

- [Generative Modelling](https://github.com/letsdodatascience/deepGenerativeModels)
- [Natural Language Processing](https://github.com/letsdodatascience/languageModels) 
- Reinforcement Learning 
- Image Analysis 
- Deep Speech
- Kaggle Competitions
- Forecasting / Predict the Future


### Economics / Incentives

I am extremely fascinated by how(*incentives*) people interact with each other, to achive their shared/dispatrate goals. I am reading [this book](https://www.core-econ.org/). This section is meant to be  place for neat things i discover about this field.


### Cryptocurrencies / In crypto we trust

I have spent too much time(*for good or bad*) thinking about a lot of critical aspects to tokens and new business models. You can find about my point of view in this section.

### Psycology / Neuro-Science / How do humans do what they do ?

### Creative Coding / ml4a 

This is my introduction to machine learning for creative interfaces and generating art. Tools used are processing, p5.js and ml5.js.
